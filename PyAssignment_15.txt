1. Please write a program using generator to print the numbers which can be divisible by 5 and 7 between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

A)

def task1(n):
    
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 5 == 0 and i % 7 == 0:
            yield str(i)+' '
task1(100)

print(', '.join([i for i in task1(100)]))


2. Please write a program using generator to print the even numbers between 0 and n in comma separated form while n is input by console.

A)

def task2(n):

    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield str(i)
print(', '.join([i for i in task2(10)]))


3. Please write a program using list comprehension to print the Fibonacci Sequence in comma separated form with a given n input by console.

A)

def fibo(n):
    i = 0
    j = 1
    for k in range(n+1):
        yield i
        i,j = j, i+j
print(','.join([str(num) for num in fibo(7)]))




4. Assuming that we have some email addresses in the "username@companyname.com" format, please write program to print the user name of a given email address. Both user names and company names are composed of letters only.

A)

def username(email: str):
    return email.split('@')[0]
print(username('john@google.com'))




5. Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which takes a length as argument. Both classes have a area function which can print the area of the shape where Shape's area is 0 by default.
class Shape:
    def __init__(self, length):
        self.length = length
        
    def area(self):
        return 0
    
class Square(Shape):
    def area(self):
        return self.length*self.length
shape_obj = Shape(10)

print(shape_obj.area())

square_obj = Square(13)

print(square_obj.area())
